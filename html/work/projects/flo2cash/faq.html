                                <li>A Direct Debit is a method of payment where a customer gives an authority to their bank that authorises the payee (or your company/organisation) to collect money from their bank account on a particular date without further action being required by the Customer. The customer might use a Direct Debit for regular amount payment as well as bills where the amount may vary from month to month, like electricity or phone bill. The amount may either be a fixed amount, it can be differed for each payment or it could even be instalment payments.</li>

                                <li>Paperless Direct Debit allows you to obtain a Direct Debit authority from the customer without the customer filling a paper based Direct Debit authority form, thereby enabling improved sales and payment processes for Direct Debit initiator and their customer.

                                <li>Direct Debit is right for any company, organisation, charity or sole trader that makes regular collections from their payers. The greatest strength of Direct Debit is the ability to vary the amount being collected and the date of collection. With Flo2Cash you can do either of these as often as you choose. Furthermore, the reporting facility ensures that you are always “in the know” and you can be proactive when one of your payers fails to maintain their commitment to you. The table below provides a few examples of organisations that would gain from Direct Debit, but there are many, many more.

                            <li>Accepting UnionPay cards for eCommerce payments is one of the most secure and safest ways to transact. Payments made online using a UnionPay card work on a “push payment” principle, whereby users are actually directed to their personal bank account to authorise the payment. This differs to the typical online Visa/MasterCard card payment process that most New Zealanders are accustomed to, but is the standard process used by UnionPay. This way of processing eCommerce payments is very secure and safe.</li>
