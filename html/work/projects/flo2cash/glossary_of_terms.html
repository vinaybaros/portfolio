                                    <h3>Acquirer</h3>
                                    <p>An Acquirer is a Visa / Master Card Affiliated Bank or Bank/Processor alliance that is in the business of processing credit card transactions for businesses and acquires new merchants.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <h3>Acquiring Bank</h3>
                                    <p>Acquiring Bank is a financial institution that provides credit card processing accounts for merchants. Also referred to as a merchant bank or an acquirer, the bank receives funds from a cardholder when a credit card transaction is completed, and then deposits the payment amount, less any fees, into the merchant’s business checking account.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <h3>Address Verification Service (AVS)</h3>
                                    <p>AVS is the process of validating a cardholder’s given address against the issuer’s records, to determine accuracy and deter fraud. This service is provided as part of a credit card authorization for mail order/telephone order transactions. A code is returned with the authorization result that indicates the level of accuracy of the address match and helps secure the most favourable interchange rates.</p>
                                </li>

                                    <h3>Adjustment</h3>
                                    <p>An adjustment is initiated by the acquirer to correct a processing error. The error could be a duplication of a transaction or the result of a cardholder dispute. The acquirer debits or credits the merchant DDA account for the dollar amount of the adjustment.</p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <h3>API</h3>
                                    <p>Application Program Interface (API) is a set of calling conventions defining how a service is invoked through a software package. Historically, “application programming interface”.

This allows the Processor to issue a Hold on funds in this account when fraud has been detected or an excessively large number of returns are received. Merchants with good credit and history can usually meet the expectations of ACH Processors for covering returns and so are not always required to keep a reserve account. In cases where a reserve is required, the minimum-reserve-balance in the account is set at about 20% of the anticipated processing volume. New merchants are usually allowed to build up their reserve by sending in transactions which are not withdrawn until the minimum reserve balance is achieved; after that, the merchant is allowed to withdraw the excess funds for transfer to their home town bank.</p>

A company processing, storing, or transmitting payment card data must be PCI-DSS compliant or risk losing their ability to process credit card payments and being audited and/or fined. Merchants and payment card service providers must validate their compliance periodically. This validation gets conducted by auditors – i.e. persons who are the PCI-DSS Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs).</p>

                                    <p>A Processor is the company that actually routes an Authorisation Request from a Point of Sale device (such as a Verfone credit card terminal) to Visa or Master Card, and then arranges for Fund Settlement to the merchant. Such processors are traditionally accessed via direct dial out modems connecting to their system. Processors need to have a Sponsoring Bank in order to gain access to the Visa and Master Card networks. When a Processor or other entity has made such an arrangement with a Sponsoring Bank to resell their services, they are called an Agent of that bank.</p>

                                    <p>Real-Time Processing means that when a web site’s customer conducts an online purchase, that the check or credit card information is conveyed to the Processor at that exact time so that an authorization can be requested and received at that moment. Real-Time Processing always implies that a Secure Payment Gateway is being utilized, whether proprietary or third party. Please see Secure Payment Gateways and Real Versus Non-Real Time Processing.</p>

                                    <h3>Reserve Account</h3>
                                    <p>One method that ACH Processor’s use to mitigate risk, is to require that merchants maintain a Reserve Account at the Processor’s Sponsoring Bank. This allows the Processor to issue a Hold on funds in this account when fraud has been detected or an excessively large number of returns is received. Merchants with good credit and history can usually meet the expectations of ACH Processors for covering returns and so are not always required to keep a reserve account. In cases where a reserve is required, the minimum-reserve-balance in the account is set at about 20% of the anticipated processing volume. New merchants are usually allowed to build up their reserve by sending in transactions which are not withdrawn until the minimum reserve balance is achieved; after that, the merchant is allowed to withdraw the excess funds for transfer to their own bank account.</p>

                                    <h3>Secure Payment Gateways</h3>
                                    <p>Secure Payment Gateway companies help other Processors conduct secure business on the internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> They provide a system that passes credit card data, authorisation requests, and authorisation responses over the internet using encryption technology.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> The transaction information is sent by the Payment Gateway secure server via a leased line to the credit card network where the validity of the card is checked and the availability of funds on that account is verified. An authorisation code is returned via the leased line to the Payment Gateway; the authorisation is encrypted by the Payment Gateway and transmitted in encrypted form to the web server of the merchant, which triggers fulfilment of the order.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> Rather than try and create their own Secure Web System, many Banks and Bank/Processor alliances will use a Secure Payment Gateway Provider to perform this task for them.</p>

                                    <p>In order to conduct secure business on the web, the Secure Gateway Provider runs a Secure Host System, and sells/licenses software modules that allow Shopping Carts and other applications to request and receive Credit Card Authorisations via their system using encrypted communications. (This is called Real Time Authorisation.)
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> The other features of this licensed software are the functions provided to merchants online when they connect to the Secure Payment Gateway host; a merchant can access their own account information, use a “Virtual Terminal” to conduct transactions, handle administrative tasks, etc. (These features all “live” on the provider’s Host computer system).</p>

                                    <p>These applications typically provide a means of capturing a client’s Credit Card information, but they rely on the Software Module of the Secure Gateway Provider, in conjunction with the Secure Payment Gateway, in order to conduct secure Credit Card transactions online.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> Any given shopping cart can work with any given Secure Gateway Provider, the only requirement being that some computer code be written or provided to communicate with the Secure Gateway of choice, and that this code be integrated into the Shopping Cart Application.</p>

                                    <p>Electronic capturing of the cardholder’s signature is becoming a powerful tool for charge back defence. At the point of sale, the customer is asked to sign the invoice, folio, or charge slip over a special digital device that turns the signature into a manageable set of digital events so that a program can reproduce the signature faithfully. A capture of the swipe and an electronic signature at the point of sale virtually assures that the customer and card were physically there and an authorization was obtained for the purchase of goods and/or services. A database maintains the signature in an encrypted form to be reproduced when requested for retrieval requests.</p>

                                    <p>A Third Party Processor is an independent processor that is contracted with by a Bank or Processor to conduct some part of the transaction processing process.
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> Some of these Third Party Processors specialise in running and hosting networks of Point Of Sale (POS) terminals connected to their Host via dial out modem; they produce the software in the POS terminals as well as in their host, and route authorization requests to Visa or Master Card as needed (MAPP, MDI, FDR, for example).
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> Other Third Party Processors specialise in the Settlement of credit card transactions with Visa and Master Card so that merchants can be paid (FDR for example).
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/> In the world of Online Credit Card Processing, the Secure Payment Gateway Provider is another type of Third Party Processor.</p>
